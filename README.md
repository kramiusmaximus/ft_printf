# ft\_printf
## Introduction
This is a library which contains a slightly more simple (in terms of functionality) _printf_ function, called _ft\_printf_. It supports the following conversions: cspdiuxX%; and the following flags:  -0.* as well as the minimum width.\
To find out more about the printf function, check out [printf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string).

## Installation
1. Clone this git repository.
2. Compile the static library by executing the command `make` in the root folder.
3. Voila! You now have a library containing a (very good yet imperfect) copy of the native _printf_ function, called _ft\_printf_, as well as all the functions included in the original libft library.

## Usage
In order to use the _ft_printf_ function as well as the other functions in the libft library, include it in your .c files wherever you call the _libft_ functions, and link the library to your project.
